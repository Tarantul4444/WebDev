    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Break the chocolate into pieces and melt together with the butter in a water bath, stirring continuously with a spatula or wooden spoon. Remove the resulting thick chocolate sauce from the water bath and leave to cool.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Meanwhile, mix the eggs and a hundred grams of brown sugar together: beat the eggs in a separate bowl and gradually add the sugar. Beat with a mixer or by hand, whichever you prefer, for at least two and a half to three minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Chop the walnuts with a sharp knife on a chopping board. They can be toasted in a dry frying pan until fragrant, but this is optional.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Carefully add the remaining sugar to the melted butter and chocolate, then add the flour and chopped nuts and mix well with a whisk.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Then pour in the sugar and egg mixture and mix thoroughly with the chocolate mixture. The colour of the dough should be even and streak-free.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Line the bottom of a small, deep fireproof dish with baking paper or tracing paper. Pour the batter into the tin. Place in the oven and bake for twenty-five to thirty minutes until the crust becomes sugar-crusted.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Put all the curd into a pan and knead with a fork so that there are no coarse lumps. Crack the eggs into it, pour in the sugar and mix thoroughly. It is best not to use curd that is too dry or too wet, otherwise the curds will fall apart as they cook.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Add 5 tablespoons (spoonfuls) of flour to the curd and mix well. You can add a little more flour to make the cheesecakes denser. Or you can add a little less flour, which will make the cheesecakes more tender. You should end up with a homogeneous mixture that you can make the cheesecakes from.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Put the frying pan on a medium heat and pour the sunflower oil into it.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Sprinkle some flour on a plate. Make a few small balls from the curd mixture and place them on the plate. It is best to make 4-5 balls at a time, as many as you can fit in the pan at once. Then roll the curd balls in flour one at a time, flatten them into small tortillas (they should not be too thin) and place them in the pan.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Fry the cheesecakes for 1 to 2 minutes until golden brown. Then flip them over to the other side and fry until golden.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Preheat the oven. Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Whisk the whites into a stiff foam with a pinch of salt and gradually add the sugar.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Continue to whisk, adding the egg yolks one at a time, then the baking powder and flour. The dough should have a sour cream-like consistency.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Grease a baking tray with vegetable oil. Pour half the batter onto the tray, arrange the evenly sliced apples and pour over the other half of the batter.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Put the tray into the preheated oven. Hold at 200 degrees for 3 minutes, then turn down to 180 and bake for 20-25 minutes.</p>
